# Deception-Detection-System-DDS-
A hybrid Honeypot + IDS built in Go. DDS combines deception techniques to attract attackers with real-time detection to analyze their behavior. It logs malicious probes, scanning activity, and suspicious payloads without executing them, making it a safe, lightweight, and effective tool for research, blacklisting, and intrusion awareness.
